1. pip install ultralytics

2. Usage:
    - edit config.yaml to change your ip_stream_url (only line you need to change)
    - run yolo_command_objects.py

    - press "Esc" to exit the program
    - press "p" to start/stop stream
    - press spacebar to do object detection.
        - You can press it when the stream is paused too. It'll just turn on the stream first then run object detection. There is a slight (but noticeable) delay when starting the stream.
        - Additionally if an object is detected, a set of dummy commands will be displayed.
        - If multiple objects are present, the centermost object is selected.
